# MediPlant Admin Image Upload Fix - Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Cart Items Removal Issue** âœ…
- **Problem**: Items removed from cart would come back after page refresh
- **Root Cause**: Frontend `removeFromCart()` function only removed items visually, no backend API call
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `/remove_from_cart` route in `app.py`
  - Updated `removeFromCart()` function in `cart.html` to make AJAX calls
  - Added proper error handling and user feedback

### 2. **Order Placement Redirect Issue** âœ…
- **Problem**: After placing order, not redirecting to "My Orders" page
- **Root Cause**: Orders table was missing required columns, causing database errors
- **Solution**:
  - Added missing columns to orders table: `city`, `state`, `postal_code`, `phone`, `payment_method`, `payment_status`, `tracking_number`, `estimated_delivery`, `delivered_at`, `notes`
  - Verified `place_order()` function correctly redirects to `my_orders`

### 3. **Order Detail Cancel Functionality** âœ…
- **Problem**: "Error cancelling order" when trying to cancel orders
- **Root Cause**: `cancel_order()` function expected JSON data but frontend wasn't sending any
- **Solution**:
  - Updated `cancel_order()` function to handle missing request data gracefully
  - Fixed JavaScript in `order_detail.html` to send proper JSON data
  - Improved error handling and user feedback

### 4. **Admin Product Edit - Image Upload** âœ…
- **Problem**: Admin product edit page only allowed image URLs, no file upload from PC
- **Root Cause**: Missing file upload input and proper form encoding
- **Solution**:
  - Added `enctype="multipart/form-data"` to form
  - Added file upload input with preview functionality
  - Updated JavaScript to handle both file upload and URL input
  - Added visual preview for uploaded images
  - Maintained backward compatibility with URL input
